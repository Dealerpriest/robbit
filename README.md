# social-robot

This project is about making an open source telepresence robot for students who can not attend school in person. The idea is that the robot will be placed on the table where the student is supposed to sit, and the student can remote control it from home/hospital/wherever via the internet. For video streaming we use WebRTC. The robots main parts are a smartphone running the app, which connects via bluetooth to a micro:bit robot for being able to move around (drive around and tilt the phone). The app is made with the Ionic framework.
