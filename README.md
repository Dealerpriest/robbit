# Robbit

This project is about making an open source telepresence robot for students who can not attend school in person. The idea is that the robot will be placed on the table where the student is supposed to sit, and the student can remote control it from home/hospital/wherever via the internet. For video streaming we use WebRTC. The robots main parts are a smartphone running the app, which connects via bluetooth to a micro:bit robot for being able to move around (drive around and tilt the phone). The app is made with the Ionic framework.

# App

run `npm install`

## Required files

Following files are required in the root of the project, but are not included in this repository. Instead there are .example files that show how they should be structured.

# Backend

## Getting started
Make a copy of backend/docker/.env.example and rename it to .env and put in the right values. These should correspond to the .env files of the app.
